“Do you judge a governing body by its weakest governmental force

Like a different view on crypto would be that some if it is governed poorly and that makes it possible to give it such a bad name in the news”
Don’t know where this is from

Werner Herzog said, about writing scripts
Each one who writes has to write has to find their own way to write

For me it is fast, urgent, and high level

I don’t sit in front of a blank page. 

First I sit in a room and 

I read Virgil 
Old Icelandic poetry
To really amp myself up 

I read and read and read and get myself in this FURY of language

To never step down below this 
And then I play music - Beethoven 

The ones with the dynamic power - to push you along
