# Summary  🍉

I grew up with a rice cooker that sang, and many japanese items. Everything else I ate was from Lebanon/Greece. My mom's best friends were two mathematicians she met in Utah - one from Lebanon and another from Minneapolis. Additionally, we had friends from Japan on my mom's side (neighbors), and my dad's friends from Japan from TV. We had some friends from China and Nigera, but Nigerian food was not something I ate as often.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144128.png]]

Bell Peppers – 5 large red bell peppers
White Onion – 1/2 medium onion
Garlic – 1/2 garlic head*
Olive Oil – 5 tbsp
Pomegranate Molasses – 3 tbsp
Walnuts – 125 grams (about 1 cup) of halved walnuts
Tomato Paste – 5 tbsp
Parsley – 1 tbsp
Cumin – 1 tsp
Sumac – 1 tsp
Mild Chili Pepper – 1/2 small pepper (or 1 teaspoon of Aleppo pepper flakes or regular red pepper flakes)**
Pita Bread – 1 small pita bread (or 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs), optional***

Step 1 – Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F). While the oven is preheating, prep the bell peppers, onion, and garlic. Cut the bell peppers in half and clean the inside, chop the onion, and wrap the halved garlic head in foil (drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil on the two halves of the garlic head before closing the foil). Drizzle 1 tbsp of olive oil over the peppers and onion and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.

Step 2 – While the vegetables are in the oven, toast the walnuts. In a pan over medium heat, toast the halved walnuts for about 5 minutes, stirring carefully so they don’t burn. Then, set aside the walnuts on a plate so they can cool.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144200.png]]

Step 3 – Toast the pita either in a toaster or for about 5-10 minutes in the oven. Then, set aside to cool.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144209.png]]

Step 4 – In a small pan, over medium heat, add the remaining olive oil, tomato paste, cumin, and sumac. Cook for just a couple of minutes to ensure the spices are toasted and the tomato paste doesn’t have its usual raw taste anymore.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144216.png]]

**Step 5** – Once the pita bread has cooled, throw it in a food processor to create breadcrumbs.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144223.png]]

**Step 6** – By now, 30 minutes should have elapsed and the peppers in the oven will be done, with a slight char on the top. Set them aside to cool and once they’re ready to handle, peel the top skin.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144230.png]]

And the garlic should have caramelized nicely.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144237.png]]

**Step 7** – Put the peeled peppers in the food processor, and give it a good mix.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144244.png]]

**Step 8** – Add the toasted tomato paste and spices and the 1/2 head of roasted garlic. Give it a mix.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144250.png]]

**Step 9** – Add the pomegranate molasses and blend.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144257.png]]

**Step 10** – Add the pita breadcrumbs, and blend once more.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144303.png]]

**Step 11** – Lastly, add the walnuts, and give it one final blend until you reach a thick, smooth consistency.

![[Media/Pasted image 20220907144310.png]]

Your muhammara should now be ready. Serve it with pita bread on the side and parsley for decoration on top.
