# Berkman Potluck 
**Potluck Dinner Wednesday** 

The tradition started 9 years ago, with the idea to provide a space for everyone to hang out in a more informal setting, outside of the academic roof. 

Usually the fellow dinners are held at the home of one of the fellows, but for this first edition, it will take place at **Cambridge's oldest** **extant house** : the [Cooper-Frost Austin House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%E2%80%93Frost%E2%80%93Austin_House) ([21 Linnaean St](https://www.google.com/maps/search/21+Linnaean+St?entry=gmail&source=g))- starting at 7:30 PM

https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/peter-b-kaufman

The dinner will be a **collectively managed pot-luck.**Please bring some food, appetizers, side-dishes, desserts, drinks or whatever you'd like to share  :)  

As per tradition, we will be focusing the discussions at dinner on a particular theme of common interest. The **theme** for this fellow's dinner will be the following:

_"Adopting a wiki-approach to the tuning of AI latent spaces_" 

  

Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday  :)

Cheers,

# Boston Notes 🍉
Back in Boston 
Differences since last time 
Not majorly depressed
Dad not dying 
Have net worth 
Chilled out a lot more as an individual 
Still need to ask more questions instead of monologuing my interests at people 
Into crypto and governance and blockchain - was not before at all and was super confused and didn’t take the time to ask people why they were interested 
Not missing berkman orientation like I did last time 
Actually working on something useful 
Oh! Also! Fit (from climbing) and NOT chainsmoking 
The house is the same! Some of my things are here. The trees are larger. 
But I don't feel overwhelmingly bad while in it like I used to! 
It took a long time to recover. 

# October Boston Trip 
19-21 Boston, MA - keynoting FEI - I might want to the extend the trip to visit friends at Harvard / MIT, so could stay the weekend with Phoebe Ayres, MIT librarian, or Wikimedian Sam Klein at Ibbetson house (my former group house)
