The beauty of commons is that we can build them ourselves, right now. But the bigger challenge is, Can we learn to _see_ the commons and, more importantly, to _think_ like a commoner? 

David Bollier has been exploring the commons as an author, policy strategist, international activist and blogger since the late 1990s. He pursues this work as Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the [_Schumacher Center for a New Economics,_](http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/) and through international collaborations with commons scholars, activists, and policy experts. Bollier's blog [_Bollier.org_](https://www.bollier.org/) and his monthly podcast [_Frontiers of Commoning,_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/frontiers-of-commoning-with-david-bollier) are popular sources of news and commentary about the commons, along with his eleven books on various aspects of the commons. These include [_The Commoner's Catalog for Changemaking (2021)_](http://www.commonerscatalog.org/); [_Free, Fair and Alive: The Insurgent Power of the Commons (2019)_](http://www.freefairandalive.org/); [_Patterns of Commoning (2014)_](http://www.patternsofcommoning.org/); [_The Wealth of the Commons (2012)_](http://www.wealthofthecommons.org/); [_Green Governance (2015)_](http://www.commonslawproject.org/); [_Viral Spiral (2008)_](http://www.viralspiral.cc/); and _Think Like a Commoner_.

Bollier founded and edited the [Onthecommons.org website](http://www.onthecommons.org/) (2003-2010) before co-founding the Commons Strategies Group, an international consulting project that assists the global commons movement. In 2002 he co-founded [Public Knowledge](http://www.publicknowledge.org/), a Washington advocacy organization for the public’s stake in the Internet, telecom and copyright policies. The American Academy in Berlin awarded Bollier the Berlin Prize in Public Policy in 2012 for his work on the commons.

Bollier now works on a variety of commons projects with international and domestic partners, and lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.
