#Ableton 


# twisted wave recorder 


# Crystallizer
Use the crystallizer instead of filter #delay since you have it 

Check into #crystallizer from sound toys 

Manual: 
https://www.soundtoys.com/wp-content/uploads/Crystallizer-Manual.pdf

You have a pitch parameter in your delay
In cents instead of steps 
Can set it to 10 or so, or 25 
If you want it to go up or down

You can expand crystallizer and automate these pieces 

Take the input of the group and you can map it onto something else 

Delay is delay 
Recycle is feedback 

Splice lengthens the section of audio that is played and fed back 
You can get metallic sounds if you make it really short 

At low it creates this really grainy structure thing 

If you want to have some sort of grainy sound you can go to Tweak and turn the pitch up 

Cents are fractions of a step 
100 cents a semi tone 
An Octave is 1200 cents 

Stuff to try 
Try automating the splice offset to see how it changes things over time 

In the track Nim Wedding this is how it works

#Capture and insert scene 

Will make everything play at the same time 

#drumbus
Use the drum bus tool to improve drum sounds 

Send your vocal group to one of the reverb returns

It will be subtle but it tires  it all altogether 

If you want the drums to have more dimension add a reverb return for the drums too

Pitch shifting 
If you don’t want it to sound like chipmunks you use complex pro and adjust the envelope  
This helps you get the most realistic sound

# Simpler 
A really basic sampler 
![[Media/Simpler.jpg]]
You can easily change the repeating region 
And you can play it like a midi synth 
By drawing in paths and things
