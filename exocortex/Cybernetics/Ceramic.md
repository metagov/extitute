Convert rather clunky ways of addressing and relating content in IPFS to how most of the modern applications work in terms of data, i.e. **data streams**.

Ceramic implements data structures that functionally match those from web2 world, such as differentiable data flow and Apache Beam type streaming objects, but, backed by distributed storage like IPFS, Arweave etc.

In practice, allows for a data cloud with easier to use objects and abstractions for high-throughput data of applications of any complexity (i.e. multiple data models) to be accessible to developers, and owned by the generators of the data and not the apps / services that host it or build features and experiences around it.

By improving developer productivity around data-sovereign distributed storage mechanisms, Cermaic is accelerating boring utopia.
