# Jacobian Matrix 
The Jacobian matrix collects all first-order partial derivatives of a multivariate function that can be used for backpropagation. The Jacobian determinant is useful in changing between variables, where it acts as a scaling factor between one coordinate space and another.

Jacobian matrices are used to transform the infinitesimal vectors from one coordinate system to another. Some Jacobian matrices allow transformation from the Cartesian to a different coordinate system.

the jacobian matrix is written as:
J = [ ∂ u ∂ x ∂ u ∂ y ∂ v ∂ x ∂ v ∂ y ]
d e t ( J ) = | ∂ u ∂ x ∂ u ∂ y ∂ v ∂ x ∂ v ∂ y |
J ( r , θ ) = | ∂ x ∂ r ∂ x ∂ θ ∂ y ∂ r ∂ y ∂ θ |
