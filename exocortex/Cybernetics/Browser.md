Every now and then a new iteration on the browser concept infects our minds.

As of today [[../Log/2022-09-09 - Deliberating]] - several new entrants are vying for the next browser title, among them: SigmaOS, Beam, Arc


# [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/)
The nLab is a wiki for research-level notes, expositions and collaborative work, including original research, in mathematics, physics, and philosophy, with a focus on methods from type theory, category theory, and homotopy theory. The nLab espouses the "n-point of view"[1] (a deliberate pun on Wikipedia's "neutral point of view") that type theory, homotopy theory, category theory, and higher category theory provide a useful unifying viewpoint for mathematics, physics and philosophy. The n in n-point of view could refer to either n-categories as found in higher category theory, n-groupoids as found in both homotopy theory and higher category theory, or n-types as found in homotopy type theory.


# Browsers 

Each of these browsers has one or two killer features. One day there will something that integrates all of them. Because of the open-source working in public effects, establishing a modular safe interoperability between a plugin-like system should allow to bring the current set of features (specific flow of work, capturing notes into an integrated personal knowledge graph)

## Beam 
https://beamapp.co/
Beam is building a web browser that gathers knowledge
![[../Media/Screen Shot 2022-09-09 at 9.36.42 PM.png]]
Killer feature: integration of Notion-like notes system and automatic capturing of websites you visit as links into its current context to automatically build a **personal discourse graph**; it even supports backlinks functionality. Because the PKM system and the web browser live in the same app, capturing information you browse is easier as it does not involve cross-app communication.

## Vivaldi (now with Hong Kong theme!) 
https://vivaldi.com/
Killer feature: Tree Tab Configurability and Maximalism of many small nifty features (like QR code, or a gazillion tab sidebar settings)

## Arc
https://thebrowser.company/
Killer feature: window manager for split views, natural language command input

## SigmaOS 
https://sigmaos.com/
Killer feature: my favorite UX innovations: social workspaces, natural language input, keyboard window manager, key-driven SuperHuman

Desiderata
- use of DID method of choice
- ownership over personal data, e.g. through [[Ceramic]]
- composability with graphs of others
- graph mining from existing data stream
