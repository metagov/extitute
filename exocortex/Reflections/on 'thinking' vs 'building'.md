I see this dichotomy emerging amongst intellectually-oriented or creative people whom I encounter. There are the "builders": those who are truly craftspeople at heart and who find great joy in the flywheel of tinkering. The desires to understand systems deeply and create beautiful designs often accompany this mindset. 

Then there are the "thinkers": those who enjoy writing, analzying, researching, and teasing apart concepts and creating new ones. There's not often a teleology to their motivations: they are often driven by ideas in and of themselves.

I've been listening to podcast interviews recently with people who 'think for a living', i.e. venture capitalists, writers, etc. 

there's something immensely valuable about having the time and space to learn and think deeply about broader trends in the world and develop theses about where we are going and where we should go.

but at the same time, I believe neither 'thinking' nor 'building' should be done in isolation -- there should be feedback loops between the ideas that thinkers play with and the material that tinkerers create. I don't see enough of this happening in the spaces I am involved in.
