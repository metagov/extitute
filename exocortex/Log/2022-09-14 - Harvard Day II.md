ontological metacrime as neojustice

Also had an amazing convo with Charlie Nesson where he talked about thrrads

The idea of nims (psudenomous networks) and identities in a trusted private group such as a law school class 

He talked about exsitutions and exclpsures
Such as determining if a jury was actually an extitution and that this was the only place where people were able to actually do justice - tasked with justice — judges applying this, but the jury having a closed door model where they are not bringing their history towards and you don’t know their past and they’re making understandings 

Also in the manga carta 
The idea of having this group represent the people and provide fair judgement to the king, to the law. Providing this legitimacy 
And the idea of a closed group of judges from the community 

Also the idea of gunners in a class and how thry work 
This allows people in a small group to actually respond to prompts
