There are two social circumstances that are possible -- the group wants to do a thing like ice cream, and you like ice cream so  you agree with them -- it would happen anyway you might do this 
What's most interesting -- an individual wants to act in a certain way but the group -- collegial pocket -- when that group successfully manages to get the individual to act in a way that isn't in the personal interests of the individual 
When your preferences are misaligned and there is a good outcome for the group

Charles -- I'm a law professor -- and law is typically distinct from norms 
Do you require hierarchy to have your concept of governance relate? we have a challenge -- how do we govern ourselves? Are we an Extititution because we don't have rules from the top on governing how we do things? 

The institution is rule based and comes down from the top 
the Extititution comes up from the bottom and is more role based 



# [[../Inbox/Primavera de Filippi]] 
you never have something that's Extititution or institution 
you still have some Extititutional organization with some instiutional fabric 
or the opposite 

Depends on how you look at it -- the wheels and the holes -- you look at it from the Extititutional lens -- you cannot have one without the other 
a stronger intensity of the institution rules 

Everything that is an institution is also an Extititution 
you're looking at a group of people and trying to describe why people are acting in this manner

Order Defined in the Process of its Emergence 
By James Buchanan 
https://www.coordinationproblem.org/2012/02/order-defined-in-the-process-of-its-emergence.html

Order Defined in the Process of Its Emergence
|Peter Boettke|

James Buchanan wrote among the best page in economic theory penned in the last 50 years in my opinion. As he explained:

I want to argue that the "order" of the market emerges only from the process of voluntary exchange among the participating individuals. The "order" is, itself, defined as the outcome of the process that generates it. The "it," the allocation-distribution result, does not, and cannot, exist independently of the trading process. Absent this process, there is and can be no "order."


What, then, does Barry mean (and others who make similar statements), when the order generated by market interaction is made comparable to that order which might emerge from an omniscient, designing single mind? If pushed on this question, economists would say that if the designer could somehow know the utility functions of all participants, along with the constraints, such a mind could, by fiat, duplicate precisely the results that would emerge from the process of market adjustment. By implication, individuals are presumed to carry around with them fully determined utility functions, and, in the market, they act always to maximize utilities subject to the constraints they confront. As I have noted elsewhere, however, in this presumed setting, there is no genuine choice behavior on the part of anyone. In this model of market process, the relative efficiency of institutional arrangements allowing for spontaneous adjustment stems solely from the informational aspects.

This emphasis is misleading. Individuals do not act so as to maximize utilities described in independently existing functions. They confront genuine choices, and the sequence of decisions taken may be conceptualized, ex post (after the choices), in terms of "as if" functions that are maximized. But these "as if" functions are, themselves, generated in the choosing process, not separately from such process. If viewed in this perspective, there is no means by which even the most idealized omniscient designer could duplicate the results of voluntary interchange. The potential participants do not know until they enter the process what their own choices will be. From this it follows that it is logically impossible for an omniscient designer to know, unless, of course, we are to preclude individual freedom of will.


The point I seek to make in this note is at the same time simple and subtle. It reduces to the distinction between end-state and process criteria, between consequentialist and nonconsequentialist, teleological and deontological principles. Although they may not agree with my argument, philosophers should recognize and understand the distinction more readily than economists. In economics, even among many of those who remain strong advocates of market and market-like organization, the "efficiency" that such market arrangements produce is independently conceptualized. Market arrangements then become "means," which may or may not be relatively best. Until and unless this teleological element is fully exorcised from basic economic theory, economists are likely to remain confused and their discourse confusing.

Explaining the spontaneous order of the market economy is one of the primary tasks of the economist according to Buchanan.  But so few economists really understand the implications of the basic Smithian insight about the "invisible hand".  This disjoint between what is really valuable about the science of economics conceived of as a public science, and what modern economists know and do, is one of the sources for the intellectual edge one can sense when studying the works of James Buchanan.  Too few economists understand basic economics as Buchanan pointed out in such classic works as Public Principles of Public Debt (1962), Cost and Choice (1969) and in the essays that comprised What Should Economists Do? (1979).

Eric 
what was a description into a normative discussion 
what makes instittitions or extitutions 

We want a normally preferealbe set of institiutions or extitutions 
you're' fundamentally 
why are we engaged in descriptive analysis 
we shouldn't lose sight of our normative 

in some sense giving people scaffolding is instutitonalizing their behavior 

case: as a counter i'd say that it's more like a cup 
that you can bring your own content to 

Angela: 
from colombia 
started a center like berkman down there 

Jessykate: 
space scholar 
and about objects 

eric: 
preprogramming enough possible actions on top of a computerized yststem 
to where effectively a human agent observing an autonomous machine cannot possibly predict the full scope of actions that a machine can take at this instance 
as a machines preprogrammed set of responses approaches the scope of the set of responses a human has -- to me, from a legal perspetcive that gets categorized as a sorty of autonomy and some legal framework and conesquences for that individual (computer) thus need to be established 

if every single one of your decsions is predicable ex ante 
you're just responding to external triggers 
and you don't have autonomy (and all of your experiences are basically to former triggers)
(and this is helpful for )
Someone who is acting soley on triggers from actual trauma 
they can be highly predicatble and not actually get out of this 

legal autonomy (you can jiust o)
if an object becomes sufficiently unpredictiable 
that is functional autonomy from a legal perspectivve 
and i am deliberatly choosing to do talk about whether 

i go after my stufents in financal markets and institiutions 
we go to the role of the federal reserve chairman 
how many of people agree with the statements of the federal reserve at this time 
95% of them said no 
how many of people think the federal reserve chairman even believes the words coming out of his mouth - he's performing the institution -- but he is extitutional in himself 
in you were in his shoes -- would you act any differenly in his role? 
no one would 

what autonomy is 
if markets are perfectly pricing in his movements at every term 

jessykate -- i wonder if we want to link autonomy to exsititions 
agency and autonomy 
where those emerge from in instutional contexts 
(the littke startups within )
instutiutons are trying to make sure you're predictable 
trying to reduce your agency 
exstitutions end up not doing that -- which is why some exsittutions -- some great statrupts exists as exstituons 
and honestly there is some chaos 
and being around chaos individuals you can really go far 

Triangle (autonomy, speed, predictaiblity) - you can only have two of these things 

we often delegate some sort of leadership and responsiublity 
we just cosntnatly have constitutional meetings (you want to take the lead on order food)

Low autonomy 
high speed 
some predicatibiltiy

Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects
The Liability Convention was considered and negotiated by the Legal subcommittee from 1963 to 1972. Agreement was reached in the General Assembly in 1971 ( resolution 2777 (XXVI)), and the Convention entered into force in September 1972. Elaborating on Article 7 of the Outer Space Treaty, the Liability Convention provides that a launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space objects on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft, and liable for damage due to its faults in space. The Convention also provides for procedures for the settlement of claims for damages.

Jessykate presented something 

Assemblage theory



Deleuze's theory (metaphor?) of assemblage as a way of thinking about the social world is an intriguing one. Fundamentally the idea is that there does not exist a fixed and stable ontology for the social world that proceeds from "atoms" to "molecules" to "materials". Rather, social formations are assemblages of other complex configurations, and they in turn play roles in other, more extended configurations.

What is appealing to me about this way of talking about the social world is that it takes us away from the presuppositions we often bring about the social world as consisting of a range of discrete social objects or things. According to this static way of thinking, the state is a thing composed of other things; likewise Islam is an extended social thing; likewise Chicago; and so on. The assemblage approach suggests a different set of metaphors for the social world: mosaic, patchwork, heterogeneity, fluidity, transitory configuration. And this seems like a more realistic way of characterizing large extended social formation like states or regulatory agencies.

The downside of this way of talking and thinking about the social world is precisely the indefiniteness and indeterminacy it suggests for the composition relation. This poses a very hard problem for explanation. How are we to explain the properties and behavior of the composite entity if there is so much contingency in its parts and the ways in which they interact? The strategy of aggregative explanation seems to be a non-starter, since it is stipulated that composition is not a strongly rule-governed process. But so do the comparative and generalizing strategies. If the composites are indeed sui generis and unique configurations we can't generalize across instances and can't usefully compare them.

So how can we gain greater clarity? The concept of assemblage is expressed by Gilles Deleuze; but it is obscure. Here is a valuable blog post by Levi Bryant in LarvalSubjects that extracts several of Deleuze's statements about assemblage from an interview. This interview provides some description of the construct in Deleuze's own words.  Here is one of Bryant's efforts at clarifying Deleuze's meaning:
Assemblages are composed of heterogeneous elements or objects that enter into relations with one another. These objects are not all of the same type. Thus you have physical objects, happenings, events, and so on, but you also have signs, utterances, and so on. While there are assemblages that are composed entirely of bodies, there are no assemblages composed entirely of signs and utterances.
It isn't easy to paraphrase Deleuze's thinking into a more analytical formulation (though Bryant's efforts are helpful). But the language remains metaphorical, suggestive, and elusive, rather than analytical and discursive. For this reason it is difficult to determine whether the concept has value for sociological theory.

The core ideas are spelled out in a somewhat more accessible form in Manuel DeLanda's A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity. DeLanda tries to explain "assemblage" by saying what it is not.  First, assemblage theory is opposed to essentialism and reification (26ff.). DeLanda emphasizes that Deleuze's concept resists the "organismic" approach to conceptualizing the social, by which he means an approach that looks at the whole as an inextricable combination of interrelated parts. This implies that the parts are implicated in each other; the organismic perspective emphasizes the internal connectedness of a thing. (This has affinity to Bert Ollman's philosophy of internal relations in Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in a Capitalist Society.) DeLanda distinguishes between "interiority" and "exteriority" in conceptualizing the components of a thing. For assemblage theory, the relations among the parts are contingent, not necessary. And, crucially, parts can be extracted from one whole and inserted into another. "These relations imply, first of all, that a component part of an assemblage may be detached from it and plugged into a different assemblage in which its interactions are different. In other words, the exteriority of relations implies a certain autonomy for the terms they relate" (10-11). Another aspect of the theory, according to DeLanda, is the fact that it does not privilege one level of organization over another. "Micro" is not more fundamental than "macro"; instead, social reality is "multiscaled" (38), with assemblages occurring at every level.

Truthfully, neither Deleuze nor DeLanda succeeds in making the concept of assemblage a very clear or analytically specific one. So let's consider a diluted version of assemblage theory that might nonetheless be useful for sociological theory while foregoing much of the metaphysical language characteristic of Deleuze's writings:
Social entities are composed of components and lesser systems.
The components of a social entity are heterogeneous.
The components include both material factors and meaningful expressions.
The components have their own characteristics and dynamics.
The components may have very different temporal and spatial scales.
The effects and interactions among components may be indeterminate because of complexity effects and probabilistic causal mechanisms.
The behavior of the whole is difficult or impossible to calculate even given extensive knowledge of the dynamics of the components.
To illustrate this set of ideas, consider a city as an assemblage.
A city consists of population, businesses, roads, organizations, government policies, political movements, disaffected youth, and slogans.
Population dynamics have a temporal scale of decades, while businesses have a temporal scale of months.
The interaction effects of gradual population change, the voting system, and gradual environmental change are difficult to calculate.
We can nonetheless make efforts to disentangle the effects of population change, institutional design, and environment on things like land use and effective taxation rates.
This reformulation suggests that large social entities are "messy" but still amenable to analysis and study; and this is what sociology requires.

(Daniel Smith's article on Deleuze in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a readable exposition of Deleuze's philosophy; link. Another useful resource on assemblage theory is Nick Srnicek's masters' thesis; link. )

CONFERENCE HELD SEPTEMBER 13-14, 2017
PUBLISHER: UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) highlight its potential to affect productivity, growth, inequality, market power, innovation, and employment. This volume seeks to set the agenda for economic research on the impact of AI. Its focus is on the economic impact of machine learning, a branch of computational statistics that has driven the recent excitement around AI. The chapters also examine key questions on the economic impact of robotics and automation, as well as the potential economic consequences of a still-hypothetical artificial general intelligence. The volume covers four broad themes: AI as a general purpose technology; the relationship between AI, growth, jobs, and inequality; regulatory responses to changes brought on by AI; and the effects of AI on the way economic research is conducted. In featuring these themes, the volume provides several frameworks for understanding the economic impact of AI. It identifies a number of key open research questions in a variety of research areas.

What a Young Philosopher Discovered More Than 200 Years Ago About Nature
Sept. 13, 2022

Credit...Evan Cohen

By Andrea Wulf

Ms. Wulf is the author of ‚ÄúMagnificent Rebels: The First Romantics and the Invention of the Self.‚Äù

As darkness settled over the small German town of Jena in the late winter of 1798, large groups of young men rushed to the town university‚Äôs biggest auditorium to listen to their new philosophy professor. They jostled for seats, took out ink and quills and waited. At the lectern, a young man lit two candles and the students saw him bathed in light.

There is a ‚Äúsecret bond connecting our mind with nature,‚Äù the professor, Friedrich Schelling, told the students. His idea, that the self and nature are in fact identical, was as simple as it was radical. He explained this by pointing to the moment when the self becomes aware of the world around it.

‚ÄúAt the first moment, when I am conscious of the external world, the consciousness of my self is there as well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand vice versa ‚Äî at my first moment of self-awareness, the real world rises up before me.‚Äù Instead of dividing the world into mind and matter, as many philosophers had done for centuries, the young professor told his students that everything was one. It was an idea that would change the way humans think about themselves and nature.

To me it seems that we sometimes forget that we‚Äôre part of nature ‚Äî physically of course, but also emotionally and psychologically ‚Äî and this insight is missing from our current climate debates. As a historian, I have looked at the relationship between humankind and nature, and I believe that Schelling‚Äôs philosophy of oneness might provide a foundation on which to anchor the fight for our climate and our survival.

Schelling was only 23 when he had become the youngest professor at the University of Jena that winter. He was part of a group of rebellious philosophers, poets and writers who lived and worked in the small university town about 130 miles southwest of Berlin. The circle included some of Germany‚Äôs most famous minds. There were the poets Goethe, Schiller and Novalis; the visionary philosophers Fichte, Schelling and Hegel; the young scientist Alexander von Humboldt, the contentious Schlegel brothers ‚Äî Friedrich and August Wilhelm ‚Äî as well as the latter‚Äôs wife, the free-spirited Caroline Schlegel (who would later divorce August Wilhelm and marry Schelling).

They worked, wrote, read and laughed together. They composed poems, drafted philosophical treatises and translated passages from great literary works. Most important, this ‚ÄúJena set,‚Äù as I‚Äôve called them, put the self at center stage and redefined our relationship with nature.

Unlike Isaac Newton, who had described matter as being essentially inert, or the French philosopher ReneÃÅ Descartes, who had declared animals to be machines, Schelling‚Äôs so- called naturphilosophie (nature philosophy) questioned these mechanical models of nature. Instead, Schelling pronounced that everything ‚Äî from insects to trees, stones to birds, rivers to humans ‚Äî was part of one great organism.

For millenniums, thinkers had turned to their gods to understand their place and purpose in the unknowable divine plan. Then, in the late 17th century, a scientific revolution began to illuminate the world in a new way. Scientists peered through microscopes to see the minutiae of life and lifted telescopes up to the heavens to discover our place in the universe. They classified plants, animals and minerals into tidy categories to impose order on the natural world, and they dissected human organs and investigated blood circulation to comprehend how the body functioned. The ticktock of new and precise clocks became the rhythm of a productive society.

This new rational approach, though, also created a distance to nature ‚Äî the external world had become something that was investigated from a so-called objective perspective. But no matter how much scientists observed and calculated, there seemed to be a more emotional and visceral connection between humankind and nature that could not be explained with scientific experiments or theories.

According to Schelling, being in nature ‚Äî meandering through a forest or walking up a hill ‚Äî was always also a self-discovery, a journey into oneself. It was a thrilling idea, and this philosophy of oneness became the heartbeat of Romanticism.

Contemporary travel accounts illustrate these changes. Many 18th-century travelers described a village, a city, a landscape or a country as detached observers ‚Äî as individuals watching from a distance. They saw the countryside through the windows of their carriages and described art and architecture through the prism of their learning and books.

Then, in the early 19th century, as Schelling‚Äôs ideas spread, the young Romantics began to feel a deeper sense of connection to the world around them. Instead of just visiting museums and cities, this new generation scrambled into caves, slept in forests and hiked up mountains to be in nature. They wanted to feel rather than to observe what they were seeing. They wanted to discover themselves in nature.

Humboldt would later describe nature as an interconnected whole where everything was entangled in what he called ‚Äúa wonderful web of organic life.‚Äù Humboldt had seen these connections during his five-year expedition through South America where he encountered many Indigenous peoples who had long regarded earth as alive and interconnected. Humboldt was also the first scientist to talk about harmful human-induced climate change when he saw the environmental devastation caused by monoculture and deforestation during his explorations.

Once nature is understood as a web, its vulnerability becomes obvious. If one part is damaged, other parts might suffer, too. This concept of nature still shapes our thinking today.

We live in a world of climate emergency ‚Äî from rising sea levels and torrential floods to a striking loss of biodiversity and mass human migration. This summer there have been extreme and terrifying heat waves across Europe, Asia and the Americas and devastating floods in Pakistan but also in Yellowstone, Kentucky and St. Louis.

Today, the Jena set‚Äôs ideas of unity with nature have been imbued with a new and desperate urgency. For decades scientists and activists have tried to convince us with predictions and statistics ‚Äî but somehow they don‚Äôt change our behavior. Most of us understand on an intellectual level what‚Äôs at stake, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be sufficient.

There is a reason the iconic photograph of earthrise taken during the Apollo 8 mission in 1968 has become one of the most influential images in history and has been hailed as the beginning of the environmental movement. It was the first time that we saw our planet ‚Äî like a small blue and white marble suspended in the vastness and blackness of space ‚Äî in its wholeness and fragility. It‚Äôs the most potent visualization that we‚Äôre part of nature.

The Jena set explained this deep bond between humans and nature more than 200 years ago. We are nature, and Schelling‚Äôs philosophy of oneness reminds us that we‚Äôre part of a great thumping web of life. ‚ÄúAs long as I myself am identical with nature,‚Äù Schelling insisted, ‚ÄúI understand what living nature is as well as I understand myself.‚Äù Just as the image of earthrise has inspired millions, so can Schelling‚Äôs philosophy of oneness.

current thing is talking about programmable money 
now there's lotsd of stocks 
lots of different ways of approaching things 



hyper barter 
the idea -- if you look at the hsitory of moeny and where it came from 
largely all societies did it 
with shells and rocks 
a way to simplfiy trandsactions 

lots of examples of goods being sold for mony 
and moeny being sold for goods 
in the future you can go beyond 
and unpack all this stuff 
and completely change what money is 

jason pontz -- hyperbarter 

then we need a hyperbarter markup language 

jessykate 
part of this is about looking at socialk dynamics about how 
these conceptd aren't covered by institutions 
and we;re introducing another realm that's intenrnally constisntet 
and that's up to us to debate 

Orbital dynamics

this is a metaphor we leberage a lot 
even though existitional dynamics like isnttuions 
we still feel we can talk about an insittituon

And Exclosure -- a phenomena in which institional rules create a naturlaly self reinfocing environment where speicifc extitutional dynamics cann persistt, 

eric 
it's privledgeing substantive intent over pure prodecural outcomes 

Can I create an exclosure for myself? to allow myself to do things within a space? yes, Clamber is an exclosure 
becaude you're speaking the same language, you're speaking the insitutional language 
a space for pure exsittutional identifity

for intersting institution 
you need more than one person

BIPS -- bitcoin improvement proposals 
the process of proposing is institutional 

if your protocol hasn't seen a certain situation 
it just stops - the protocol kills itself 

Eric
I think the unintended conesuqences peice is very importnat 
the US founders were very concerned about faction 
they chose a protocol member districts that converged us to a two party systems 
the founders didn't want this initally 
but now the founders in the system have this two party system

In orbital dyanmics you don't have repulsion 
only gravaitaitonal attraction 
but they are not rejecting berkman - they are getting attracted to other things 
you have a graviational example that is repulive to some poeple and very attractive to others 

you are so attracted by

this is evocative of legal discussoion 

the rule of recognitionn
the central foundation is central to every legal system 
its referring to some set of extititonal elements that allow a constitution to amend itself 

 the king's two body problem 
 the king ghas a body but when is ruling is a different governing body 
 exitutional body as a king 
 instititonal whole as a king 
here we've identified a third body 

the king has two bodies 
a body mortal 
and a body politic 
putting on a costume with all of the signifiance of that institutional role 

SJ 
i want to talk about how we game instituationality and extitutionality 

Eric 
Starting a court that's a coin toss court 

The hypothesis is 
the more codeified and therefor strict the institution is 
the more you require in order f ofr the thing to surivive 
and vbe viable 

the stronger isntitution is 
the stronger the extitutional dynamics you need to keep it alive 

blockchain is so codified 
so you need strong extitutions 
in order to survive you need these 

as institutions proliferate rigitidity dominates 
which creates extititonal need 

the more the insition is on tje outside 
the more likely the discretion will emerge on the inside 

exstitution is just like setting up a procedure
