New day

What does it mean to be a human? 
Special spirals and strange attractors 
Zip files of nostalgia
Of hanging on to objects and thoughts 

What does it mean to work on a project? 
To gather people 
To come up with ideas
But not know how to work with them 
To clarify 

Missing that bridge from one brain to another 
So much I have 
Experience in seeing one fractal up 
But I too, lack the words

If only there were some shared text
At Galois I was asked to read one book 
To shape my brain 
The Traction Gap 
And it helped 
But I also trained my brain 
Meditated 
10 minutes a say every day 
Shrank my amygdala 

Getting rid of all of these things I carried
So I can travel light 
It doesn‚Äôt mean letting go of the past
It means letting go of a repeating future 

Can you love 
Through all of the hardship 
To the other side? 

I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm above all addiction 
Since I take so few stimulants
But it is not true
I crave input in all forms 
It arrests me when I wake 

I am still highly functional 
But only a shadow of what I could be 
That shadow is enough for everyone somehow 
They don‚Äôt see how much more if I didn‚Äôt have it 

Everyone is addicted to something 
Where does the night end? 

Today people are asking so many questions 

Like a dog, 
I must wait to eat 
The queen died today
