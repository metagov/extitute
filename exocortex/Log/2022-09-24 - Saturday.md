Some examples of a thesis 
https://www.media.mit.edu/users/login/?next=%2Fposts%2Fall-things-thesis%2F 
Can I feed some into GPT3 and then have it output a new kind of thesis or research statement that would fall within what the program would like?

Applying to this program 

thinking of going into the viral media group and considering the ideas of viral media loosely as well as extitutional theory 
really to mess some things up, ideally.  but to also metaMETAmeta on some notions on what the media lab means, and bust into it in a different way 

to *survive* boston I must act extitutionally anyway, which i've traditonally been very good at. through cyborgcamp, through study groups, through small spaces with lots of interesting people 

-   **How many years is the master's program?        
    **The MAS master of science degree requires a residency of two academic years. Students take five academic course subjects over two years, in addition to research work.  (that's not bad at all) 
    
-   **Can I apply directly to the PhD program?  
    **All MAS students begin at the master's level and have the option to apply to the doctoral program in their second year.
(sounds good - can either do that, or go onto P's Extitutional PhD program)
