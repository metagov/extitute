Oct 9, 2020

If you have not caught this at Berxtitute, these were the two blogposts @Sam Klein had shared as forming the research agenda (in my own recollection, right now mostly around capturing different ways people come together around graphs and making them interoperable):

there are just so many! :) underscores why we need an underlying set of composable interfaces for these personal / collaborative knowledge management graphs

Brilliant, yes, Rhizome / Quartz are a lot better than [Obsidian.md](http://Obsidian.md) and the best part is that we can import Markdown into it!

Rhizome Proposal

"Murray: I come from an audio production background and often sound and storytelling through sound is the last thing that exhibition designers consider. It sort of gets tacked on, so it is not a holistic approach where everything is working together to create one unified experience. That is what Art Processors does. Sound is as important in the whole as everything else and it is not something that gets tacked on or thought of as a last-minute solution. That is how it is immersive, in my opinion.
