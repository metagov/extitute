## Making new blocks
Making new blocks
My brain feels good with new blocks 

It‚Äôs this small nice feeling 
Of comfort 
Or ‚Ä¶ something else 
To know that there is someone 
Who has nodes? Vertices? Proteins? 
That march 

We need to have more fun as a species 
Or we‚Äôre dead 
Fun makes things works 
Develops things
Pushes people forward 
People are falling apart in the US right now 
It‚Äôs heavy 
In Spain, people aren‚Äôt falling apart 

Today I saw Nine Inch Nails and had a lot of high school memories. 


## Ideal house to call a home üìπ
that 90s condo was for a while my dream space
that i drew out literally years ago
so it's a joy to stay there
i could not live in one alone
it is good for parties
my dream house? hmm
i have expensive taste
which is why i often live in little closets
for me, a house either needs to be
1. the best house EVER (like my house) with the office in back
2. reasonable with lots of light in a SUPER GOOD location (my old apartment -- small but walking distance to mt tabor, coffee, etc and in a BEAUTIFUL neighborhood


Not too big
You don‚Äôt want to get lost in space
You don‚Äôt want to lose yourself to a dark room
every room has to be good

here is a legit hidaway home

Wood and light
living in a showy place just doesn't
make for living

This stuff
for your room
breaks up the flat walls
the volume, being broken, is more pleasing to the eye
more human scale

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002406.png]]
 
the floor and wall don't just HAPPEN
there is a grace to it

just these small volumetric additions
add a kind of peace to a room

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002430.png]]

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002436.png]]

see how the ceiling is also kind of curved?
it affects the acoustics
and it is pleasant
that floor is fake, though

real things have a good texture
real things make real people

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002448.png]]

light
curves
volumetric breaking
angles
human scale

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002459.png]]

now COMPARE
90 degree angles
no gradient volumes
it is BAD
feels bad
this is the SAME HOUSE
the house must be coherent

so this is why in your upstairs bedrooms
still good bedrooms!! just different feel
it hasn't had the same attention paid to it

volumes applied to the outside of a building

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002524.png]]


volumes applied POORLY

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002535.png]]

volumes applied harmoniously

look at how the light illustrates them
they have more dimension

if you don't have them, you live a life of less dimensions
and most americans get to live 2 dimensional or 2.2 dimensional at most

on all axis points
food, shelter, music, fashion, material, love, work, transportation

it is a SAD SACK OF LAME
so living in a real place
on a real street
in a real place with real people

makes for, over time, a more 3 dimensional life
Do you know why I love the Mission?
It's the oldest neighborhood
or at least one of the oldest

a Place is something with Identity, Relation and History
a Non-Place, like an airport or a highway, lacks those
it puts people on pause

"Non-place or nonplace is a neologism coined by the French anthropologist Marc Aug√© to refer to anthropological spaces of transience where human beings remain anonymous, and that do not hold enough significance to be regarded as "places" in their anthropological definition. "

they're all over boston - those streets
BUT there is no love in boston

it's so white
I like the mission because there are real people mixed in

![[Media/Pasted image 20220908002202.png]]

oh gawdddd
imagine how many people
live there

I think this all the time
i had to experience driving by those
as a kid in denver
just...
yeahhhh
i mean. i get sick
their entire lives
and their children's
so so so sad

dehumanizing
yeha
just meat storage

i know folks that live in these places
they have life
but its a kind of 7-11 convenience store kind of life
they can be perfectly happy
PROVIDED they are never given aesthetics other than ads

## Health ü©∫
I have been forced by my body to address the sleep deficit today in annoyingly time-consuming ways. But, as a bonus, it has actually allowed me to stay asleep during the warmest hours of the day (warmest hides the devastating heat and sweaty lethargy it begets).

Fun is in no short supply, though. [[../World/Indiviaduals/Seth Frey]] was at the office today, and got to meet [[../World/Indiviaduals/Michal Karmi]] -- it was hilarious to observe him observing her, and when she started talking about tuning into the energies of the place, I said we need to connect her to be an Oracle chain for [[../World/Organizations/Plurigrid]]. 

[[../World/Indiviaduals/Seth Frey]] is fantastic and is still at the office. He suggested a DoE benchmark for adversary trying to cause overload of the grid, and that if we pass that with flying colors, we would have already made it. He also advised on the public goods + startup interplay, and seems to be very comfortable as an advisor. What a catch!
