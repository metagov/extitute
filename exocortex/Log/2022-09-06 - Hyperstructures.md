It was 1982 when I made my first observations concerning the mechanism of memory that were later used in the formulation of the SuperMemo method. As a then student of molecular biology I was overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge that was required to pass exams in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The problem was not in being unable to master the knowledge. Usually 2-3 days of intensive studying were enough to pack the head with data necessary to pass an exam. The frustrating point was that only an infinitesimal fraction of newly acquired wisdom could remain in memory after few months following the exam.

My first observation, obvious for every attentive student, was that one of the key elements of learning was¬†[active recall](http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall "Active recall"). This observation implies that passive reading of books is not sufficient if it is not followed by an attempt to recall learned facts from memory. The principle of basing the process of learning on recall will be later referred to as the¬†**active recall principle**. The process of recalling is much faster and not less effective if the questions asked by the student are specific rather than general. It is because answers to general questions contain redundant information necessary to describe relations between answer subcomponents.

To illustrate the problem let us imagine an extreme situation in which a student wants to master knowledge contained in a certain textbook, and who uses only one question in the process of recall: What did you learn from the textbook? Obviously, information describing the sequence of chapters of the book would be helpful in answering the question, but it is certainly redundant for what the student really wants to know. The principle of basing the process of recall on specific questions will be later referred to as the¬†**[minimum information principle](http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum_information_principle "Minimum information principle")**¬†. This principle appears to be justified not only because of the elimination of redundancy.

Having the principles of active recall and minimum information in mind, I created my first databases (i.e. collections of questions and answers) used in an attempt to retain the acquired knowledge in memory. At that time the databases were stored in a written form on paper. My first database was started on June 6, 1982, and was composed of pages that contained about 40 pairs of words each. The first word in a pair (interpreted as a question) was an English term, the second (interpreted as an answer) was its Polish equivalent. I will refer to these pairs as¬†**items**.

I repeated particular pages in the database in irregular intervals (dependent mostly on the availability of time) always recording the date of the repetition, items that were not remembered and their number. This way of keeping the acquired knowledge in memory proved sufficient for a moderate-size database on condition that the repetitions were performed frequently enough.

From #anselm in response to how does value get stored in a protocol 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything. I can speculate. I imagine small communities often made informal agreements in the past - we each take turns making dinner and so on. 

at the heart of this is simply a sense of fairness; it feels like humans are fairly sensitive to knowing when somebody is freeloading ? Like I think we have an instinct for this.

As communities grow a bit they appear to invent schemes to track these debts and promises - it becomes more formal ‚Ä¶ not a lot more formal mind you ‚Ä¶ the issue isn‚Äôt knowing a debt or even writing it down but rather preventing bad actors from abusing these schemes - basically the question is more around security and trust - less about the schemes for storing numbers - 

Typically in the ancient past debts were secured by a social trust graph - debts were fairly transparent (and human memory and or scratches on paper or say seashells or other difficult to forge artifacts were good enough) ‚Ä¶ the success/fail of debt tracking just has to be good enough that freeloaders don‚Äôt bring the system down - a few smart and lazy people will always circumvent any scheme ‚Ä¶ but in softer schemes and in a world where most debts are personal, intimate, social, and especially prone to expiring - super formal schemes don‚Äôt seem really necessary - just ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù schemes ‚Ä¶

Note any community has many currencies - and those currencies are not always fungible with each other - nor should they be. I think actually a currency is equal to a sub group or population of like interests. There can be tokens for social clubs, food clubs, farming communities, and each has perks privileges rights obligations - each with different rules around velocity, currency aging schemes (interest or depreciation) and schemes for securing trust (trusted parties, scarce metals, validator nodes).

Fiat in a way is a bit sick / unhealthy as a concept because it normalizes energetic exchanges across vastly different scales and ecosystems . It lets rich people crush poor people. In a real world no hyper predator can  harvest all the grain in a field or exhaust the mineral resource or labor resources of an entire community. The liquidity is unnatural and diminishes diversity.

So if you build a really nice modern public / private key scheme with full blown math and crypto and a scheme to prevent double spending - you really are tackling the ‚Äútrust‚Äù issue . Given modern blockchain schemes you can guarantee trust . What you have not done however is assign value. Value comes from outside of crypto itself. Ledgers are used to track some external concept of value typically.

So where does value come from?

In a fiat currency the value seems to come from bullets. The use of force. Citizens are forced to use the currency.

Bitcoin was perceived of as the future - a cross border - free - I captured - and notably conceptually scarce ledger. It was seen as a valuable social club , but also in a sense the future.

What is the value of a ledger? It may not be 20k per bitcoin. But it probably isn‚Äôt zero. There are features of the scheme that make it useful. To participate you have to fight others to get some of the tokens. The current price is exactly the amount that other people are willing to fight you for the token.

Newer ledgers like juno also have a value based on features. There are some nice features. You buy into that club and that community. And holding the token let‚Äôs you buy specific products available in that community (this is incidentally why I really think juno should focus more on consumer products and services such as say dao tools or voting tools or really pragmatic apps - not esoteric features).‚Äù

To which pam responded: 

‚ÄúJuno is not a blockchain but a sandbox. It‚Äôs a great community/ network and I think it‚Äôs good for more people to enter the space and experiment but it loses all functional aspects of what makes a blockchain what it is.. like immutability.. but that‚Äôs also a question of governance. I don‚Äôt think the process was as thought as it could have been. manual state change of a network doesn‚Äôt qualify. Cosmos is a very interesting space. Ethereum is probably closer to what blockchain is visioned to be.. but that‚Äôs also changing with the Merge and POS. It‚Äôs challenging to design technical systems that don‚Äôt centralize in time.‚Äù 

Technically value/data gets stored on a block every x period, by miners or validators of a network. That data is either stored on a permissioned database or distributed one like IPFS or Arweave‚Äú

https://docs.regen.network/modules/ecocredit/ for example, I would propose issuing credits based on creating Hydrogen, but would need all the validators/ community to agree

Just start. Pattern of organization emerges as you take notes. That is subjective to the way you take your notes. But, if you strictly want to bring about an organization in obsidian since the beginning, there are a few techniques such as MoC - Map of Contents, creating Fleeting, Literature notes in folders of the same name, and many more. But, I would honestly recommend you to just do what you are doing, and that's what I did and I love it! Give it a try!

/-

Keep taking notes and experiment with tags. There is a way to view the tags you have in use so you can be consistent about it.

The organization into folders will click one day. You'll think 'these should be together' and then they are. Moving files is easy. No structure is permanent in Obsidian.
