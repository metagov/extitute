üçâ Hello, this is a note 
How my brain works when approaching a new thing.

"exponential curves feel gradual and then sudden"

At first I will not look like I am doing a thing. 
Then It will be very obvious what I am doing. 
Patience. 

My brain gathers many pieces and approaches of a new thing. Then, at some point, there is enough density and all of the perspectives interconnect 

Also, I really enjoy this process.
