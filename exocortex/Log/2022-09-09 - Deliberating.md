First day in the world without Elizabeth. Would she have liked to stick around longer in the end, or was the passing a relief of a kind, a departure from tortured existence? It seems that the idea of a monarch is so archaic, and Charles certainly looks it, however, any number of otherwise reasonable Brits seem devastated - is it the royal they are mourning, or the passing of time, the irrevocable march towards maximum entropy?


## Embassy of what exactly? ü§î

I have spent the day yesterday mostly at [[../World/Gemeinschaft/Embassy SF]], a place that felt more lived in and livable than any of the dwellings I have inhabited over the past decade. Some residents have lived in the house for ~10 years, perhaps contributing to the gradual refinement of the space.
