Paper review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbMhGgR0UQA 

They found that 1300 images were the minimum to train a dataset. That's a lot! 
"Some of my largest datasets are StyleGAN"

Rotation version StyleGAN3 might be worse vs. using translation version. 

"I'd love to see more papers dealing with data size. Because 1300 is a LOT.""

So can we try this with like 300?

Style Transfers and two different types of GANs (DCGAN and CycleGAN).

Lets try a small set to see what  happens.

Default is K_LMS.

Hmm - this doesn't let you train anything. 

Oh but the results are COOL

# Teachable Machine 
How to easily download bulk images for training a model on Teachable Machine
Teachable Machine (TM) is Google‚Äôs generous way to make machine learning more accessible. You can train models to recognise images, sounds and body poses by classifying your own input images. As an example, you could teach TM to identify your left and right head movements as two separate classes, which could then be used to control a mini-game of snake in ml5 in your browser. Oh wait, that‚Äôs exactly what my internet hero The Coding Train did. Cool stuff!

Train ML on some Pinterest galleries to generate new work 
Create a compendium of that work 
Maybe mint it as NFTs? Cheap NFTs?

Here‚Äôs what I wrote to reintroduce myself to the Berkman center after I left in 2018 

[bkc-announce] Intro! DAOs, DAO game, and Calm Technology

Hi all!¬†

I was a BKC Fellow from 2016-2017 and an Affiliate from 2017-2018! I‚Äôm super thrilled to visit again this week to meet so many wonderful people.¬†

My work focuses on the following areas:¬†

1. Calm Technology - a framework for building ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù tools that focus on the task, not the tool. But also an overall framework that respects attention. It was originally proposed at Xerox PARC, but overlooked as it was quite ahead of its time. I‚Äôve archived many of Mark Weiser and JSB‚Äôs papers on calmtech.com and wrote a short O‚ÄôReilly book about it.¬†

Lately, this work has taken on a life of its own, with entire startups and larger companies taking on the principles. From Virgin Global, to Amazon and several major car companies. I‚Äôve tried to remain very neutral and pass-through myself during this time. I want the framework to stand the test of time - promoting both technology and human universals that can be relied upon for multiple generations.¬†

Probably the most interesting startup that has been inspired by the principles has been Mui Lab in Kyoto, Japan. They‚Äôve worked towards blending IoT into traditional wooden furniture design in a beautiful and harmonious way, and have started to gather global attention.¬†

2. While the Calm Tech was just getting underway during my time at BKC, I eventually found my way into blockchain and governance. I remember Primavera talking so frequently about these ideas, and with such passion. I am typically a really late early adopter, so it took me some time before I started joining DAOs and really allowing my mind to be blank and capable of absorbing new material without preconceived notions about what I thought crypto was. Very quickly I realized how interesting DAOs were.

As a way of learning, I started to play like a kid on a playground! I helped start some cute DAOs like Dinner DAO (a governance experiment and ‚Äúminimum viable DAO for groups of 8 and monthly dinners). I also joined Unlock Protocol last year to learn more about NFT-based memberships and how people can own their own contracts and do many more things with the web using new tools.¬†

3. In November, I went to the Cosmoverse conference in Lisbon, Portugal, and I met Jake Hartnell, formerly of Hypothesis. He was working on a new system called DAO DAO, which builds the Lego blocks for DAOs, and the ability to work on DAOs more readily without the need to write smart contracts or be an expert at writing code. I really loved the idea, and the tooling had not been totally built out yet. I got into the Discord and started doing interface reviews and submitting bugs.¬†

Over time, I learned a lot about the people behind the scenes (many Berkeley students and graduates!) and this furthered my interest in hanging out with the DAO DAO crew! I joined more fully recently, and am now working as a Co-Founder of the project. You can check it out at Daodao.zone.¬†

4. In line with wanting to more deeply understand DAOs, I‚Äôve been working on a tabletop game that simulates the early experience of working on a DAO. It is called DAO Game! We had a very good play through during Decentralized Web Camp, and I‚Äôll be revising it accordingly! It will be free and available to everyone.¬†

That‚Äôs the contents of what I‚Äôve been excited about recently! Can‚Äôt wait to see you all and catch up soon! I brought my BKC hoodie, but it might be way too hot out to wear it!¬†

Please reach out anytime during the week. See you all very soon!¬†
